**OVERVIEW**

This project aims to classify different species of the Iris flower using various machine learning models. 
The Iris dataset, which is a classic dataset in pattern recognition, includes three species of Iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. 
The objective is to predict the species based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.





**DATASET:**

The dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset, which can be accessed from Kaggle. 
It contains the following columns:

   **Id:** Unique identifier for each entry.
   
   **SepalLengthCm:** Length of the sepal in centimeters.
   
   **SepalWidthCm:** Width of the sepal in centimeters.
  
   PetalLengthCm:Length of the petal in centimeters.
   
   **PetalWidthCm:** Width of the petal in centimeters.
  
   **Species:** The species of the Iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).





**LIBRARIES USED:**

This project utilizes the following Python libraries:

**Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.

**Scikit-learn:** For implementing machine learning algorithms and evaluating model performance.

**Seaborn and Matplotlib:** For data visualization.






**MODEL EVALUATION:**

Four different models were evaluated for their performance on the Iris dataset:

Decision Tree Classifier

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

**PERFORMANCE METRICS:**

The models were evaluated based on the following metrics:

**Accuracy:** The proportion of true results among the total number of cases examined.

**Confusion Matrix:** A table used to describe the performance of the classification model.

**Classification Report:** A report that includes precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.



**RESULTS**

After evaluating the models, the accuracies were as follows:

Decision Tree Classifier: 1.00

Logistic Regression: 1.00

Random Forest Classifier:1.00

Support Vector Machine:1.00




**CONCLUTION:**
This project provides insights into the classification of Iris species using machine learning techniques. 
The results show that some models perform better than others, which can guide future work in improving model accuracy or exploring different algorithms.
